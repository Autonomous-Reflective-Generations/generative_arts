all efforts are shared publicly and treated as creative commons.

except intellectual value and efforts that derived from public tools incorporated.

 contributors and maintainers of `generated.space` and `photomosh.com` will be compensated and included in NFT royalty schemes, prior to artworks . 

those artworks will be minted as individual `ERC721`s and mostly, as `ERC1155` sets.

in ERC1155 case, they'll receive a number of copies of regeneration (audio)visuals as attribution that as well compensates financially.

a new standard on ethereum smart contracts, `EIP-2981` will be tried for those to include a globally accessible royalty information, residing in NFTs' metadata files.
