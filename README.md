  
    Autonomous Reflective Generations (ARG)

back in 2021, tried to regenerate some of my drawings and paintings with open /source and for use/ libraries and tools out there. 

initially tried `noisfy`at `generated.space`, and published outcomes at:

https://www.behance.net/gallery/128199015/

 some tools and filters, as well as to open a space for collaboration and prepare this repository for: 

---
`something unique,` `something real.`


--- 

so far, visual applied via https://photomosh.com and some regenerations with
https://generated.space/

from here and now on, future generations and regenerations, will be built in a branched fashion to be minted on blockchain, 

eg.  // as individual `ERC721`s and mostly, as `ERC1155` sets.

`EIP-2981` will also be tried for those to include a globally accessible royalty information, residing in NFTs' metadata files.

in the meantime, will contact to contributors of those public tools, and offer share in case earning happened. hence, some more supplies will be configured per image/token, to share some as gift to those tools' contributors.
